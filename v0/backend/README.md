**Instructions:**  
- Use **basic authentication** (e.g., JWT or simple API key or simple username/password) to secure the endpoints, ensuring only authenticated users can interact with the app.

- For the local datastore, use **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** to persist the data. You may choose whichever you're most comfortable with. If needed, provide an example schema for Users, Products, and Orders.
- Feel free to add any additional features (pagination, error handling) based on your knowledge.

**Bonus (Optional):**
- Implement basic **input validation** for each endpoint (e.g., required fields for creating users/products/orders, valid data types, etc.).
